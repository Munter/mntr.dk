abstract: |-
  Web fonts and web performance are diametrical opposites. Web fonts slow down your time to meaningful paint due to inefficient loading behavior. Web fonts are also empowering your designers to improve legibility and keep brand consistency on your web pages. Choose one: Performance or design?

  I'm here to tell you how you can choose both, and how tools can automate the process for you.
